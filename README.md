**"It’s Not Bragging If You Can Back It Up:  Can LLMs Understand Braggings?"**. 
Our research provides a comprehensive study into how LLMs recognize, explain, and generate bragging—a complex and pervasive social-linguistic phenomenon. This work highlights the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in navigating nuanced social interactions.

# Core Rewriting Strategies
The dataset currently focuses on several key strategies for transforming communication:

- The Humble Brag: Framing an achievement or point of pride as a complaint, a burden, or an inconvenience. This allows the speaker to share positive information indirectly while feigning humility or frustration.

- The Professional Showcase: Translating a personal achievement into a quantifiable, professional accomplishment. This strategy focuses on demonstrating value, capability, and impact in a business or career context, often using specific metrics and results.

- The Understated Flex: Hinting at a significant achievement or status through a casual, offhand remark or a seemingly mundane observation. The impressiveness is implied rather than stated, making it feel more natural and less like a direct boast.

- The Enthusiastic Share: Transforming a self-focused boast into an inclusive, high-energy invitation for others to share in the excitement. This strategy shifts the focus from personal status to a shared positive experience, fostering connection and community.


# Coming soon

值得一提的是，在中文网络文化中，“bragging” (吹牛) 有一个更巧妙的对应词：**凡尔赛**，特指一种“以退为进”的谦虚式吹嘘。相关的中文数据集我们也即将开源，敬请期待！

It is worth noting that in Chinese internet culture, the concept of "bragging" has a popular and nuanced counterpart: **凡尔赛 (Fán'ěrsài)**, which specifically refers to the art of humblebragging. We are also preparing to release a corresponding Chinese dataset. Please stay tuned for updates!
